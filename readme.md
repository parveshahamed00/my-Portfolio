## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi, I'm Parvesh Ahamed and I would like to design and develop amazing Websites.         I'm 19 and student doing BSc Information Technology. I was born and
        living in Tirunelveli TamilNadu, during lockdown days I was just
        wandering on social medias and one fine day I saw that Fullstack
        Development is a demended job with the highest demanded ratio I don't
        even know what is it, even though I'm a cs student so I've done some
        reach on what is fullstack development and how to become a fullstack
        developer and later I've gained some knowledge and decided to become a
        fullstack developer. I've started my joueney by learning html, css and
        bootsrtap for responsive design, later I've done some responsive designs
        using what I've learned and then I've taken some challenges on frontend
        mentor and devchallenges.io for backend I've decided to mecome a MERN
        developer Mongodb Express React Node it took more than 6 month for me to
        cover all this concepts and to become a fullstack developer. I'm ready
        to work and to do intrenships, my goal is to become a knowledgeable
        developer by learning new skills and keep updating my skills daily and
        to become a developer at FANG.
